## About the tool

This tool was created as a collaboration between Nesta and Innovate UK,
to explore the future of AI in UK cities.

This interactive map shows entities operating in the AI industry in the UK.

These are:
- `Company`: commercial organisations involved in the direct production of AI products, services and processes
- `Incubator/accelerator`: bodies for whom supporting new AI ventures is a core focus
- `University and Research and Technology Organisation (RTO)`: academic institutions with a strong AI research or teaching focus, Catapult centres, etc
- `Funder`: organisations which provide grants for AI ventures or R&D

Entities are represented on the map by coloured dots.
Dots of multiple colours indicate entities that fall into multiple categories.

To learn how to use the tool, please check the guides in the app.
