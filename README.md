# UK AI Map

## About this map

This interactive map shows entities operating in the AI industry in the UK.

Entities are:
- `Company`: commercial organisations involved in the direct production of AI products, services and processes
- `Incubator/accelerator`: bodies for whom supporting new AI ventures is a core focus
- `University and Research and Technology Organisation (RTO)`: academic institutions with a strong AI research or teaching focus, Catapult centres, etc
- `Funder`: organisations which provide grants for AI ventures or R&D

Entities are represented on the map by coloured dots.
Dots of multiple colours indicate entities that fall into multiple categories.

This map has been created as a collaboration among Nesta and Innovate UK, exploring the future of AI in UK cities.
